I woke up and open my eyes...
_______________
"Where am I...."
_______________
I found I has been trapped in a maze
I cannot remember how I get to here
"Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!"
A loud cry came from nearby
It is A monster "*" stand behind a wall "#"
"Emmm, what is that shining thing?"
I found that is a old sword "S" behind that monster
"Maybe I can find a way out...."
